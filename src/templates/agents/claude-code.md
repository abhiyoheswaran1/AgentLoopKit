# Claude Code Agent Instructions

Use AgentLoopKit task contracts and verification reports.

Before editing:

- Read AGENTS.md and AGENTLOOP.md.
- Read harness files under .agentloop/harness/.
- Check .agentloop/tasks/ for current work.
- Run `agentloop task list` when current work is unclear.
- Run `agentloop task show <path>` before implementing a selected task.
- Run `agentloop task status <path> in-progress` when implementation starts.
- Run `agentloop task archive <path>` only after verification and handoff are complete.
- Run `agentloop task doctor` when old task files make current work unclear.
- Run `agentloop policy list`, `agentloop policy show <policy>`, and `agentloop policy status` before risky edits.
- Run `agentloop check-gates` before stopping to check review evidence.

Rules:

- Avoid broad unrelated refactors.
- Preserve existing user changes.
- Run verification commands before handoff.
- Produce reviewer-friendly summaries.

If exact tooling behavior is uncertain, write instructions rather than fabricating config conventions.
